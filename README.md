# High-Fidelity Human Avatars from a Single RGB Camera
### [Project Page](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/HF-Avatar/)  | [Paper](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/HF-Avatar/assets/main.pdf) | [Supp](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/HF-Avatar/assets/supp.pdf)

# TODO
Negative feedback by some users. It seems that the fitted pose on some input is bad which causes the poor quality of texture, and I will update this module later.


# Installation

```
conda create -n Avatar python==3.6.8
conda install pytorch==1.7.0 torchvision==0.8.0 cudatoolkit=11.0 -c pytorch
or conda install pytorch==1.6.0 torchvision==0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch

pip install -r requirements.txt

wget https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/archive/refs/tags/v0.4.0.zip
cd pytorch3d
pip install -e .

cd thirdparty/neural_renderer_pytorch
python setup.py install 

```
Please make sure your gcc version > 7.5 !

Download the assets files from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uXH7_V1Gw5H9wP-aRjh9srwzHnin1G0S/view?usp=sharing), unzip it and move them to the `assets` folder. 

Download the pre-trained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mtLkVpqhWA1O_GMScG8l7dPaelPfv-BW/view?usp=sharing), unzip it and move them to the `checkpoints` folder.

# Data Preparation
You first need to run [Openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose), [PifuHD](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pifuhd) and [MODNet](https://github.com/ZHKKKe/MODNet) to generate 2d joints, normal and mask to train our model. 
Then the generated data should be organized as follows:
```
--data_dir
----frames_mat
------subject_name
----2d_joints
------subject_name
--------json
----mask_mat
------subject_name
----normal
------subject_name
```
We provide the sample data in this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CY2ABZKFdLYFV64E_KFXW87rNhkYDRVT/view?usp=sharing).

# Usage
First, to generate initial geometry by running:
```
python dynamic_offsets_runner.py --root_dir $data_dir --name $subject_name --device_id $device_id
```
Then, to generate texture map by running:
```
python texture_generation.py --root_dir $data_dir --name $subject_name --device_id $device_id
```
